        <h2>How I Started</h2>
        On Firday as started with the webhosting assignment. 
        The instuction was to use any of the codes we have used on freecode camp.
        I went into my freecode camp account and copied one of the projects.
        I then transfered it to my Visual Studio Code.

        <h2>Problems I Faced</h2>
        In VS code i added some more codes because i wanted to show the teacher that i had 
        put effort into it and that i was a serious student.
        Now for the webhosting i went to yutube and watched some videos on webhosting.
        After a couple of videos I decided to use github since i already had an account.
